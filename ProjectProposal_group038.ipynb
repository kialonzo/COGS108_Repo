    "As the occurrence of police-involved shootings continue to increase, the public is becoming more and more aware of them. We aim to look for a causal relationship between the number of bills proposed in California for a given period and the number of reported police-involved shootings. We hope to construct a model that can track these future happenings and find a relationship between enforcement shootings and an increase or decrease in bill proposals. The proposal of bills in California are actions that will certainly be present in the future as government officials are always looking for ways to improve their quality of living. The continued use of firearms in State Enforcement will provide future data of enforcement related shootings.  \n",

    "conducted a study on the impact of mass shootings on gun policy. They found that mass shootings evoke large policy responses, specifically, a 15% increase in firearm bills inroduced.They also found that the amount of firearm bills that were actually enacted into law depended on the party in power, with a Replican controlled legislature resulting in less gun restrictions. They concluded that there was no significant effect of mass shootings on enacted laws for tighter gun restrictions. This study is relevant to our project in terms of how they analyzed and visualized the bills that were introduced.\n",

    "Raheem Hosseini points out in his article, \"Will California Change Policing\", how current law enforcement related bills are being proposed in response to shooting involving police. Hosseini states that law enforcement groups claim that a bill that would bar officers from using chokeholds wasn't explicit enough for officers to know they can defend themselves. Hosseini includes an assembly member's response which was that the right for officers to defend themselves is clear in the state penal code so they didn't want to make the bill text redundant. This is relevant to our topic because the level of how explicit a bill's text tends to be. We will used a broad range of terms when trying to pull out the law-enforcement related bills from the database.\n",

    "- The ideal dataset would contain observations by year (or month, if possible) of bill proposals related to law enforcement with variables consisting of:\n",
    "  - number of bills in the given period\n",
    "  - number of reported police-involved shootings in that period (aka number of victims)\n",
    "  - politicians who introduced said bills\n",
    "  - keywords mentioned in each bill title\n",
    "- This ideal dataset is everchanging based on the research currently being conducted, but overall, we hope to have a chronological dataset consisting of information pulled from the news records of police shootings and type/number of bills proposed. The data will most likely be organized by year unless a web scraping tool can be constructed to pull exact dates from each bill. A list of common \"law enforcement terms\" will also be created through our research in order to know which bills fit the description of \"relating to law enforcement\".\n",
    "- The bill count within said finished dataset should strictly be of California in order to reduce scope, but will still retain nationwide reported police shootings as our research question focuses on the reports in the media, rather than police shootings within CA.\n",
    "- We will collect the data on proposed bills using web scraping (BeautifulSoup) and read the csv dataset from the Washington Post using pandas. The final dataframe will be made using pandas and used to generate plots with a combination of Seaborn and Matplotlib.\n",
    "- Dataframe will end up a combination of strings (Politician names, bill keywords) and integers/floats (keyword counts, bill counts, number of reported shootings). The strings may assist us with discovering trends while the numerical data will help us visualize trends if there are any."
