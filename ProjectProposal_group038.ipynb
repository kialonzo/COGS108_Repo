        "As the occurrence of police-involved shootings continue to increase, the public is becoming more and more aware of them. We aim to look for a causal relationship between the number of bills proposed in California for a given period and the number of reported police-involved shootings. We hope to construct a model that can track these future happenings and find a relationship between enforcement shootings and an increase or decrease in bill proposals. The proposal of bills in California are actions that will certainly be present in the future as government officials are always looking for ways to improve their quality of living. The continued use of firearms in State Enforcement will provide future data of enforcement related shootings.  \n",

They found that mass shootings evoke large policy responses, specifically, a 15% increase in firearm bills inroduced.They also found that the amount of firearm bills that were actually enacted into law depended on the party in power, with a Replican controlled legislature resulting in less gun restrictions. They concluded that there was no significant effect of mass shootings on enacted laws for tighter gun restrictions. This study is relevant to our project in terms of how they analyzed and visualized the bills that were introduced.\n",

Hosseini states that law enforcement groups claim that a bill that would bar officers from using chokeholds wasn't explicit enough for officers to know they can defend themselves. Hosseini includes an assembly member's response which was that the right for officers to defend themselves is clear in the state penal code so they didn't want to make the bill text redundant. This is relevant to our topic because the level of how explicit a bill's text tends to be. We will used a broad range of terms when trying to pull out the law-enforcement related bills from the database.\n",
